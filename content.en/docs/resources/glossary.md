## Automated Market Maker (AMM)

An automated market maker is a smart contract on Ethereum that holds liquidity reserves. Users can trade against these reserves at prices determined by a fixed formula. Anyone may contribute liquidity to these smart contracts, earning pro-rata trading fees in return.
